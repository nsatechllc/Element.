## Element.SDK : Post-Quantum Cryptography

Welcome to the **Element.SDK**, the secure, proprietary software development kit that connects your applications to the powerful **Element. Quantum Security Module (QSM)**.

Element. is engineered to deliver high-performance, quantum-safe cryptography specifically for demanding modern transport protocols. **While fundamentally a high-assurance Hardware Security Module (HSM)**, we brand it as a QSM to emphasize its specialization: securing your traffic against the quantum threat.

By offloading all critical cryptographic functions to the **Element. QSM**, we ensure your **QLS (Quantum Layer Security) over QUIC** traffic is protected by an uncompromised, **future-proof root of trust**. This solution eliminates the typical performance and compliance overhead associated with PQC migration.

### ‚ú® The Element. Advantage: Proprietary QSM PQC Assurance

The core strength of the Element. solution is the fully integrated, proprietary architecture, designed from the ground up to address the unique requirements of **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**, including key establishment and authentication using the new NIST standards.

| Proprietary Component | The PQC Security Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Element. QSM (The Hardware)** | **Uncompromised Quantum-Safe Key Protection.** The Element. is a physically **hardened, tamper-resistant module**. All cryptographic keys (including classic and PQC keys) are **born, live, and die exclusively within this secure hardware boundary**, providing the highest level of assurance against both classical and quantum-era threats ("harvest now, decrypt later" attacks). |
| **QLS-Over-QUIC Engine** | **Accelerated PQC for High-Speed QUIC.** We utilize proprietary firmware and hardware acceleration to overcome the performance overhead inherent in PQC algorithms (which have larger keys and signatures). Our dedicated engine ensures near-zero-latency for your QLS handshake, supporting: <ul><li>**ML-KEM** (Crystals-Kyber) for **Quantum-Safe Key Exchange**</li><li>**ML-DSA** (Crystals-Dilithium) for **Quantum-Safe Authentication**</li></ul> |
| **Proprietary Operating Layer** | **Zero Exposure & Total Crypto-Agility.** The SDK provides a strictly controlled API surface. Keys never leave the QSM for any operation. The proprietary operating system enforces strict separation of duties and continuous audit logging, allowing for **rapid cryptographic updates** without hardware replacement (Crypto-Agility). |

### üöÄ Key Capabilities: Securing the Future of Transport

Element.SDK offers a robust set of services, all powered by the high-assurance Element. QSM:

* **QUIC/QLS Handshake Services:** Secure and rapid post-quantum key agreement and digital signature verification for establishing quantum-safe QUIC connections.
* **Remote Key Management:** Secure generation, storage, usage, and destruction of all cryptographic keys, managed exclusively within the **Element. QSM**.
* **Compliance & Audit:** Enterprise-grade audit logging, strict nonce management, and irrefutable proof-of-operations for regulatory compliance.
* **Scalable APIs:** Robust endpoints for signing, key derivation (CBID), session management, and health checks, designed for high-availability cloud deployments.

### üîë Access & Usage Restrictions

**Element.SDK and the Element. QSM service are strictly proprietary assets of NSA Technologies LLC.**
